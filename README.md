### Data Structure

Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way.

### Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

### Algorithm Efficiency

The complexity of an algorithm is a function describing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the amount of data the algorithm must process.

There are two main complexity measures of the efficiency of an algorithm:

- Time complexity
- Space complexity

For both time and space, we are interested in the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm.

### Time complexity 

Time complexity is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

### Space complexity 

Space complexityis a function describing the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

### Asymptotic Notation

These are the mathematical notations that are used for the asymptotic analysis of the algorithms. The most common notation used is "big O" notation.

### Big O Notation

It measures how quickly the run-time grows relative to the input, as the input increases of an algorithm. Another way to say, it is used for calculating the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.
