# üßÆ Data Structures and Algorithms

> Being a good programmer is not about learning new languages, it is about solving complex problems in efficient way.

## Data Structure

Data structure is a way of organizing the data, so that it can be used **efficiently**.

### Usage

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers

### Categories

Data structures are divided into two categories:

- Linear data structure
- Non-linear data structure

### Linear Data Structure

Data elements are arranged in a linear order.

Examples are: array, stack, queue, linked-list etc.

Applications of linear data structures are mainly in application software development.

In a linear data structure, memory is not utilized in an efficient way.

### Non-linear Data Structure

Data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.

Examples are: trees and graphs.

Applications of non-linear data structures are in artificial intelligence and image processing.

In non-linear data structure, memory is utilized in an efficient way.

## Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

### Algorithm Efficiency

Algorithm efficiency relates to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm.

For maximum efficiency we wish to minimize resource usage.

### Algorithm Complexity

The complexity of an algorithm describes the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the input size.

Two main complexity measures of an algorithm:

- Time complexity
- Space complexity

### Time complexity

Time complexity is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

### Space complexity

Space complexity a function describing the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

## Asymptotic Notation

These are the mathematical notations that are used for the asymptotic analysis of the algorithms. The most common notation used is "big O" notation.

### Big O Notation

It measures how quickly the run-time grows relative to the input of an algorithm. Another way to say, it is used for calculating the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.

## Arrays

- Array is the simplest data structure
- Array used to store list of items
- Array is the optimal data structure for accessing data by their index
- In many languages like (C#, Java) arrays are static
